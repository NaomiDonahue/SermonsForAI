WHO WERE YOU?

I want each of you to think back to the moment you were saved.  Where were you?  What were you doing?  What was the most important thing in your life at the time?  Were you looking for healing and forgiveness? Perhaps you were not looking for forgiveness at all – but Jesus showed up and you surrendered your life to Him.  

Better yet, who WERE you when you were saved?  

Last week we looked at the healing of the Paralyzed man and saw Jesus demonstrate that he INDEED had the power and authority to forgive sin.  Now, Jesus calls one of the cultures filthiest sinners to follow him. As you will see, Levi was a man with a greedy heart who immediately became a giver.

SHOW ON SCREEN:

Luke 5:27-32 (NLT) 27  Later, as Jesus left the town, he saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax collector’s booth. “Follow me and be my disciple,” Jesus said to him. 28  So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him. 29  Later, Levi held a banquet in his home with Jesus as the guest of honor. Many of Levi’s fellow tax collectors and other guests also ate with them. 30  But the Pharisees and their teachers of religious law complained bitterly to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with such scum?” 31  Jesus answered them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor—sick people do. 32  I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners and need to repent.” 

Those of us who are familiar with this calling look at the name “Levi” and immediate understand that this is “Matthew, the tax-collector.”  Before Matthew became known as Matthew the Evangelist – he was known as Levi, the tax collector.  Mark and Luke call the ta-collector, Levi.  
Mark 2:14 (NLT) 14  As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at his tax collector’s booth. “Follow me and be my disciple,” Jesus said to him. So Levi got up and followed him. 

But in the Gospel of Matthew, Matthew writes:

	Matthew 9:9 (NLT) 9  As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man named Matthew sitting 	at his tax collector’s booth. “Follow me and be my disciple,” Jesus said to him. So 	Matthew got up and followed him. 

It was not unusual for Jewish men to have a couple of different names. It was also not unusual after a man had an encounter with the Living God his name would change:

Abram became Abraham.
Sarai became Sarah
Jacob became Israel
Simon became Peter
Saul of Tarsus became Paul
…and Levi became Matthew

THE WEALTHY DON’T NEED JESUS.
LEVI was transformed from a GREEDY tax collector to a follower of Jesus.  You have heard it said that it is harder for rich and wealthy people to surrender their lives to Jesus.  They feel as though they are not in need of anything.  Yet, here is a wealthy and healthy man who surrenders to Jesus.

	•	Levi did not have any physical deformity.  
	•	He was not demon possessed.  
	•	He did not have a fever.  
	•	He did not have leprosy. 
	•	He was not paralyzed. 
Yet the actions and words of Jesus touched his heart in such a way, he immediately gave up everything to follow Jesus.  There was no thunderous voice from heaven.  No miraculous catch of fish.  So what did Jesus do that was so compelling to Matthew?
In order to understand, we must look at the context that Luke provides.
SHOW ON SCREEN: 
	Telones: Collector of Taxes, the word is used 22 times in the Gospels.
When the word is used by Jesus or the Gospel writers, it provides a framework in which we can understand how precisely they were viewed:
SHOW ON SCREEN:

	•	TAX COLLECTORS WERE REJECTED AND FRIENDLESS:
Matthew 18:17 (NLT) 17  If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church. Then if he or she won’t accept the church’s decision, treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector. 

	•	TAX COLLECTORS WERE CONSIDERED THE WORST OF THE WORST:
Luke 18:11 (NLT) 11  The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed this prayer: ‘I thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like everyone else. For I don’t cheat, I don’t sin, and I don’t commit adultery. I’m certainly not like that tax collector!

	•	JESUS EQUATED TAX COLLECTORS WITH PROSTITUTES
Matthew 21:32 (NLT) 32  For John the Baptist came and showed you the right way to live, but you didn’t believe him, while tax collectors and prostitutes did. And even when you saw this happening, you refused to believe him and repent of your sins. 

Why so much hate and disdain for the tax-collector? 
	•	THE DISTRICT
	•	They earned their position by “outbidding” other tax-collectors for a district of land.  
	•	The highest bid, won the rights to collect taxes.  
	•	They earned a salary, paid the “bid” to Rome, over the year would attempt to earn their money back.
	•	They could charge individuals as much as they wanted.  
	•	They had the full authority and backing of the Roman Soldier to collect taxes from people who resisted.  
	•	They received SALARY from the ROMAN GOVERNMENT and they stole a profit from the people.  

	•	THE TOLL BOOTH
In busy districts, the tax-collectors had toll booths along the roads.  As people passed by they could be taxed any amount the tax-collector desired.  HE had a KEEN eye and would observe the tiniest details about those that passed by…if they had a bag of money fastened to their belts…if they wore fancier clothes hidden under rags…they taxed per axel, per cattle, per wheel…
Against the TAX COLLECTOR the POOR were kept poor, the RICH were GUTTED and PROVEN POWERLESS, and the RELIGIOUS LEADERS even barred tax collectors from worship!
Why hate? Because they took what they wanted and they had the POWER of the ROMAN MILITARY backing them up when resisted.
	•	Levi was JEWISH and HATED by the ROMANS (his EMPLOYER).
	•	Levi was a TAX-COLLECTOR and HATED by the Jews (his own people).
	•	Levi was HATED by PEOPLE everywhere he turned.

KEY: Except when he encountered Jesus.
Jesus spoke to the man who other’s hated. Jesus spoke to the man that all others had rejected.  Jesus spoke to the man who sat at the edge of loneliness in life.  Although he had all he wanted, he could never by acceptance.
Jesus INVITED a man who was well-known for his GREED to follow him…and LEVI said, “Yes!”  
LEVI’S “YES” WAS SUDDEN AND TOTAL:
	•	He got up
	•	He left everything
	•	He followed Jesus
The simple INVITATION to FOLLOW Jesus was so transformational, GREEDY LEVI became GIVNG MATTHEW.  (Matthew = God Gives or Gift of God) 
Consider what LEVI gave up when he said YES to the LORD and followed him.
SHOW ON SCREEN:
“YES” COSTS ALL.
We have already seen the calling of Peter and his brothers in the Gospel of Luke. When they “left their nets and followed Jesus” they did not have much to give up.  If “following Jesus” didn’t work out for them – they could easily return to their occupation.  In fact, in John 21 toward the end of the Gospel, Peter and a few other disciples had done just that.  They returned to their old life, just before “restoration” into following Jesus.
But LEVI WOULD never be able to work for the ROMANS again.  He ABANDONED the toll booth in the middle of the road!  He abandoned his POST!  By many in the Roman Government, this proves to them that he would be unreliable to secure taxes in the future and thus – LEVI’s “YES” came at GREAT PERSONAL COST.  
If FOLLOWING JESUS did not work out – HE COULD NOT return to his old life.  But we see immediately, he DID NOT want to. Almost immediately:
SHOW ON SCREEN:
HIS GREED STOPPED AND HIS GIVING BEGAN.
Luke 5:29 (NLT) 29  Later, Levi held a banquet in his home with Jesus as the guest of honor. Many of Levi’s fellow tax collectors and other guests also ate with them.
ALTHOUGH he had lost his job, he still had resources and he used his house, his influence, and his money to help others meet Jesus.  This Party was Levi’s’ TESTIMONY of TRANSFORMATION.
HE GAVE A BANQUET TO GIVE OTHER’S LIFE.
The very purpose of this party was to introduce his old-friends to his new friend, Jesus. Matthew did not go out “make new friends” to tell them about Jesus.  He threw a JESUS centered PARTY and gave all the friends from his past a chance to meet Jesus and follow him too.  Why?
Because JESUS showed him kindness.  
	•	Acceptance.  
	•	Grace and MERCY 
	•	and MATTHEW wanted his old friends to EXPERIENCE JESUS too.

All Matthew had known was REJECTION and SCORN from his fellow PEOPLE until he met JESUS.  

SHOW ON SCREEN:
FOLLOWING JESUS MEANS INTRODUCING OTHERS TO HIM.
Often something happen likes this for those who are newly saved.  Unchurched and unsaved friends often hear about Jesus from their friends who have recently surrendered their lives to Jesus.  The tragedy is that after those newly saved people have been in the church for a while, they begin to find it more and more difficult to relate to and build relationships with those who do not yet know Christ.  
Jesus NEVER suffered with this problem.  Throughout scripture, we never see Jesus running or hiding from the “sinners” of the world. Rather, he meets them where they are, at their level, engages with them, and offers life-change.
Some people around you may have a difficult time if you begin to live radically for Jesus and invite the “worst of the worst” into your home to share the Gospel with them.   The Pharisees responded outrageously too:
SHOW ON SCREEN:  
Luke 5:30 (NLT) 30  But the Pharisees and their teachers of religious law complained bitterly to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with such scum?” 

Can you imagine being so self-righteous, so high and mighty that you pointed people out and called them scum?  The Pharisees looked down on tax-collectors so much, that scholars say that they would not even allow their robes to brush up against a tax collector…and Jesus was eating with them!

Jesus sitting down with the tax collectors was a CULTURAL sign that he ACCEPTED and LOVED them.  But he was not merely “hanging out” with them. He was INTENTIONAL about what he was doing.  He replied:

SHOW ON SCREEN:

Luke 5:31-32 (NLT) 31  Jesus answered them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor—sick people do. 32  I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners and need to repent.”

Jesus agreed with the Pharisees that these men were SINNERS!  He compared them to sick, diseased ridden people who were dying.  They did not have LEPROSY. The SICK were not able to heal themselves – they could only RECEIVE the HEALING from the DOCTOR…and that is precisely what Jesus was doing.  He was instructing them, warning them, teaching them, loving them, and leading them to TRULY LIVE.

As you attempt to share the GOSPEL with others, focus on those who KNOW THEY ARE SINNERS.  Those who KNOW they ARE sinners do not need to be convinced of their need for forgiveness – they need to hear about the great physician who can cure them.

Jesus is the GREAT PHYSICIAN who can HEAL the BODY and HEAL the SOUL.

INTRODUCING OTHERS TO JESUS HAS AN IMMEDIATE AND FUTURE IMPACT

Because Matthew went out of his way to invite his former fellow tax collectors to meet Jesus, tax-collectors kept coming to Jesus throughout the gospels.  Luke writes:

SHOW ON SCREEN:

Luke 15:1-2 (NLT) 1  Tax collectors and other notorious sinners often came to listen to Jesus teach. 2  This made the Pharisees and teachers of religious law complain that he was associating with such sinful people—even eating with them! 

If you have found your hope in Jesus, tell others.
