MEETING JESUS
THE ASCENSION 
April 16, 2023
Luke 24: 36-53

If you have your Bible or Your Bible App, go ahead and turn to Luke 24. We are continuing in our sermon series called “Meeting Jesus.” For the rest of 2023, we will be taking a look at the Gospel of Luke and developing applications for our lives.

If you do not have a Bible with you today, that is ok. We got ya covered. Our main passage of scripture will be on the screen. You can also scan the QR code on the back of the seat in front of you and download our Beach Church app to follow along with today’s message.

Also, if you do not have a copy of the Bible that you can read or understand easily in your home, stop by our Book store, and pick up a copy of God’s Word.  

Here at Beach Church, we are fully convinced if we read God’s Word and Apply His word, he will change our lives.

We celebrated Easter last weekend, and it was amazing! 

I want to thank all of our volunteer ministry teams for helping guests feel welcome, safe, and accepted.  Our First Impressions team, parking lot team, safety team, Guest Central, Coffee, Kids ministry volunteers, our worship team, prayer team, ushers…

Thank you for doing all you could to lead people to Jesus last weekend and every weekend.

We are celebrating 2,244 people on our campus last weekend. 475 for Good Friday and 1769 for Easter Worship.

Working together in harmony and unity, we will continue to lead people to a life-changing relationship with Jesus.

Today’s passage of scripture will overlap with last weeks scripture. Last week we looked at the Resurrection, and this week we will look at the ascension of Jesus.

Let’s read together:

Luke 24:36-53 (NLT2) 36  And just as they were telling about it, Jesus himself was suddenly standing there among them. “Peace be with you,” he said. 37  But the whole group was startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost! 38  “Why are you frightened?” he asked. “Why are your hearts filled with doubt? 39  Look at my hands. Look at my feet. You can see that it’s really me. Touch me and make sure that I am not a ghost, because ghosts don’t have bodies, as you see that I do.” 40  As he spoke, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41  Still they stood there in disbelief, filled with joy and wonder. Then he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” 42  They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 43  and he ate it as they watched. 44  Then he said, “When I was with you before, I told you that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must be fulfilled.” 45  Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures. 46  And he said, “Yes, it was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer and die and rise from the dead on the third day. 47  It was also written that this message would be proclaimed in the authority of his name to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem: ‘There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.’ 48  You are witnesses of all these things. 49  “And now I will send the Holy Spirit, just as my Father promised. But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven.” 50  Then Jesus led them to Bethany, and lifting his hands to heaven, he blessed them. 51  While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up to heaven. 52  So they worshiped him and then returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy. 53  And they spent all of their time in the Temple, praising God. 

If you are a follower of Jesus, meaning at some point you made the decision to trust your life to Jesus. You understood that Jesus died on the cross to pay the penalty for your sin, you asked him to forgive you and your accepted him as your Savior.

That only happened because, like we see in verse 45…

LOWER THIRDS:
GOD HAS OPENED YOUR MIND TO UNDERSTAND THE BIBLE v. 45
The disciples had seen Jesus do some pretty amazing things. 
He healed people who were disfigured. 
He fixed the sight of people who were blind. 
He healed the deaf and they could hear. Over and over, he healed people with diseases. 
Miracle. After Miracle. After Miracle.
Yet the disciples still could not believe that Jesus was the Savior that the Old Testament prophets had taught about – until Jesus opened their minds.
The crazy thing is, these disciples had heard the Old Testament prophecy.  In fact, by the age of 10, boys had to have memorized the first five books of the Old Testament.
Genesis. Exodus. Leviticus. Numbers. Deuteronomy.  In the Jewish language, that was roughly 80,000 words!
Most likely, these men had these five books of the bible memorized…and they attended the synagogues each week to worship God and hear the teaching of God’s word on the Sabbath.
But even though they had memorized 80,000 words.
Even though they attended the synagogue for worship every week of their lives.
Even though they spent roughly three years with Jesus.
They were still limited in their understanding of scripture. 
They knew God created them. 
They knew that Adam and Eve chose to sin, and sin entered the world. 
They knew that all descendants of Adam and Eve sinned. 
They knew THEY were sinners…and they knew they were separated from God…
BUT they did not UNDERSTAND why JESUS died on the cross and rose from the dead.
They heard, but did not understand.
When I was a child, I went to a Private Catholic School and Catholic Church.
I understood that God created me.
I understood Jesus paid the price for sin on the cross. 
I understood he rose from the dead.  
But nothing in me changed until God opened my mind to understand my need to surrender to Jesus.
And, if you have surrendered your life to Jesus, it is only because a miracle has taken place. 
God has opened your mind to understand the hope found in the Bible…
So if you are feeling a bit overwhelmed with sadness today, be encouraged! The creator of the Universe loves you and he chose to open your mind and showed you how to apply HIS TRUTH to your life. 
You have been FORGIVEN.
And we also see in this passage…
LOWER THIRDS:
FORGIVENESS IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH CHANGE v. 47
In verse 47, Jesus said “There is forgiveness of sin for all who repent.”
REPENTANCE and FORGIVENESS are two separate words that communicate one idea.  Some people get confused about the word repentance. 
They live their lives thinking repentance is living a life filled with remorse and guilt and shame from their past. They don’t allow themselves to become the person God has created them to be, because they do not understand what repentance actually is.
Repentance is simply a “change in direction.”  
Let’s suppose you are in your car on the 501 headed to Conway.
But instead of west on the 501, you are driving east!  Instead of heading to Conway, you are driving to the Coast.  If you do not make a change in direction, you will never arrive in Conway. 
If you really want to get to Conway before you drive into the Ocean, you make a UTURN and change your direction…
That is what it means to REPENT.
When you repent and surrender your life to Jesus, you make a UTURN in life.
If you have been forgiven, you will WANT to please God.  
You will show signs that you reject the sinful lifestyle you have been living, and you will stop doing those things. Some things you will immediately stop doing, and other sins it may take some time, 
but the difference is…there has been an inward change because you have been forgiven.
The word FORGIVEN is actually a mathematical term. 
When an individual borrowed money from a lender, their name was written down in a ledger. As the person made payments on what he owed, the payment was subtracted and a new balance would be recorded.
But if the lender FORGAVE the debt, they would open the book find the name and completely blot out that individuals name and amount due.  
It was erased. It was as though it never existed in the first place.
The person that owed that money was no longer in bondage to the lender. They were no longer loaded down with debt…
They were free.
God has dealt with sin the same way.
If you have surrendered your life to Christ and received Jesus as your Savior, it is now as though your sin had never existed in the first place.
Your sin has been erased through the sacrifice of Jesus.
Your sin has been removed from existence.
You do not need to live like you are still loaded down with the guilt and the weight of your past lives.  You have been set free.
So live like it. Embrace the freedom that God has given to you through Jesus.  Demonstrate the freedom of forgiveness through a visible change in your life.  
And…
LOWER THIRDS:
LIVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT v.49
Luke 24:49 (NLT2) 49  “And now I will send the Holy Spirit, just as my Father promised. But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven.” 
We see this incredible promise fulfilled in Acts 2.  After Jesus ascended into heaven, these men and women gathered together in a room. They were praying, then…
Acts 2:2-6 (NLT2) 2  Suddenly, there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm, and it filled the house where they were sitting. 3  Then, what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them. 4  And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit…
If you are new to following Jesus, please understand.  
The HOLY SPIRIT of God does not live inside a church building, a statue, or a painting on the wall.  The Holy Spirit of God lives inside YOU.
When I grew up I was told the church building was God’s House.
I had to speak reverently and quietly.
I had to dress nice.
I couldn’t wear a hat.
I was told to behave in God’s HOUSE.
I now know that God does not live inside of brick, steel, and drywall.  A buikding is an insufficient place for the Holy Spirit to live.
The house of the Holy Spirit is reserved for God’s most incredible creation – you and I.  
God did not abandon us to figure out life on our own! You have been changed not through a decision that you made, but through the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit.

Lean into the presence of the Holy Spirit in your life. Let Him Guide you to be baptized, or to serve, or to invite others to worship with you. Let the Holy Spirit guide you in your generosity and in your relationships.
So, Since God has opened your mind, since you have been changed, and since you now have the Holy Spirit..
You can live under the influence of the Holy Spirit! That means…
LOWER THIRDS:
JESUS BLESSED OTHERS, AND SO CAN YOU. v. 50
Luke 24:50 (NLT2) 50  Then Jesus led them to Bethany, and lifting his hands to heaven, he blessed them. 

That word BLESSED can be hard to understand.   
I was an altar boy. I remember the Priest taking Holy Water and flicking it on people in the church – and that was considered a BLESSING.   
In the movie ROCKY…right before his big fight, Rocky asks Father Carmine for a BLESSING. And Father Carmine said a prayer in Italian and made the sign of the cross.   

We say God Bless you when somebody sneezes.

BUT what does it mean to biblically bless others? I want to encourage you to write this down.   
A BLESSING means:  TO SPEAK WELL OF, TO THANK, OR TO ASK GOD’S FAVOR UPON AN INDIVIDUAL. 
So as Jesus was leaving, he wasn’t telling his disciples that they better have their rooms clean when he gets back home.  

He did not threaten to punish them if they did something wrong while he was gone.   
 
Before he ascended into Heaven – Jesus spoke well of his disciples.  He thanked them. He asked God’s favor upon them.   
 
He BLESSED them through ENCOURAGEMENT.  He Spoke words of LIFE over them.  

He didn’t point out all their flaws – and he certainly could have – instead he focused on using his words to cause their hearts to swell with joy…not just joy – GREAT JOY. 

Typically if somebody is saying goodbye to a loved one…because they are headed out for a long trip, moving away, or even passing from this life…most don’t waste their breath being critical.  

Some might.  But most people will not waste their being critical and talking about how much their loved ones have disappointed them. 
 
😊It reminds me of the Seinfeld episode which Frank Costanza creates a holiday called Festivus and at the Festivus dinner he goes around the table and tells everybody why he is sick of them! 😊
 
The sad truth is, while many people may not have a Festivus tradition like that, many choose to live every day like that.   
 
They use their words to criticize, tear down, and destroy other people.   
They use their words and influence to hurt others…and who knows why?   
 
WORDS of BLESSING can bring great JOY to others. 
 
Don’t you feel good when others speak well of you?  Don’t you feel good when somebody goes out of their way to say THANK YOU to you and appreciate and value you?   
 
Let me give a real life example: 
Marty and Stephanie Parker would you please stand?
For almost two years that Beach church was without a Pastor, Marty and his wife Stephanie stepped in as volunteers to help. Marty preached, he worked in the student ministry, he kept loving and encouraging people.  
Marty even shared that he would like to be considered as the lead Pastor here at Beach – and when the PSC moved in a different direction, Marty kept serving. He didn’t pack his bible up and go home or stop serving. 
He kept preaching, volunteering, and helping out wherever he could.
Don’t you appreciate that about Marty?
Wouldn’t you love to have Marty on our team here at Beach?
Well, beginning May 1, Marty will join our team as Associate Pastor with an emphasis on Family Ministry.
(Join me in welcoming Marty by blessing him with words of encouragement in the lobby after the service)
Anybody can be a critic, anybody can point out things about others that they feel are wrong – but followers of Jesus can see the positive about people and love others with the love of Jesus and speak well of them. 
Let’s Pray.
