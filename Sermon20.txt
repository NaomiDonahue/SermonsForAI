THE GOD WHO SEES ME
Luke 6:6-11 (NLT) 6  On another Sabbath day, a man with a deformed right hand was in the synagogue while Jesus was teaching. 7  The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely. If he healed the man’s hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath. 8  But Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to the man with the deformed hand, “Come and stand in front of everyone.” So the man came forward. 9  Then Jesus said to his critics, “I have a question for you. Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing evil? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it?” 10  He looked around at them one by one and then said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” So the man held out his hand, and it was restored! 11  At this, the enemies of Jesus were wild with rage and began to discuss what to do with him. 

I recall a childhood schoolmate who had a shriveled arm.  One arm was perfectly normal, but his left arm appeared to be only tissue.  It was about one fourth the size of his healthy arm, with just a couple of miniature fingers at the end.  

‘Don’t stare” is what the teachers always said…” It makes him uncomfortable.”
The word Luke used to describe this man’s right hand is:

Xeros:  (xsay-ros): members of the body deprived of their natural juices, shrunk, wasted, withered
The author of Hebrews used that very same word in Hebrews 11:29 to describe the land of the Red Sea the Israelites crossed over upon…
The ground had been wet – now it was dry.
This man once had the use of his arm – but it had been damaged, maimed, mutilated.  It was useless, drawn up, dried up, and shrunk.  It was once a strong arm – and now it was lifeless and good for nothing.  This wasn’t a man who was born with a “special need.”  He knew what it was like to USE his arm – but something happened and he could no longer use it.
HE HAD PLACED HIMSELF IN A POSITION TO HEAR THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS:
When Jesus is teaching and people are listening – something POWERFUL and LIFE-CHANGING is about to occur.  Here Jesus is in the SYNAGOGUE – TEACHING and it just so happens that a man with a DEFORMED RIGHT HAND is in the synagogue LISTENING.  
This man wasn’t asking for a miracle, rather he was sitting in the synagogue exposing his heart and minds to the teaching of Jesus.  His priorities were ON-POINT.  He was seeking TRUTH.  
The RELIGIOUS LEADERS knew the heart of Jesus.  They were watching him closely because they knew that JESUS would have compassion on this man and heal him.  Then they could make accusations against Jesus.
The first truth I want us to focus on:

	GOD KNOWS YOUR THOUGHTS
Luke 6:8 (NLT) 8  But Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to the man with the deformed hand, “Come and stand in front of everyone.” So the man came forward.
Isn’t it interesting that even WHAT we THINK is known to GOD?  I can’t imagine how anybody could make it through life if those closest to them KNEW what they were thinking.  Would you survive long at work if your boss knew your thoughts?  Would you survive long at home if your spouse knew your thoughts?
God hears and knows our thoughts so plainly – we may as well be broadcasting our thoughts with a mega-phone.  We think we can hide our thoughts – we can not!

These men sat in the synagogue not as learners, but as people who were hoping to undermine the mission of Jesus – and JESUS knew their THOUGHTS the entire time.  We can HIDE NOTHING from the LORD.  
THEN, WE SEE A “BACKWARD INVITATION.”
SHOW ON SCREEN:
Luke 6:8b (NLT) ...He said to the man with the deformed hand, “Come and stand in front of everyone.” So the man came forward.
BEFORE JESUS had healed the MAN, he brought him to stand in front of EVERYBODY!  If the RELIGIOUS LEADERS were wanting to accuse Jesus of doing something – Jesus would give them all the ammunition he needed.  Jesus had a FIERCE DETERMINATION to ACCOMPLISH the MISSION that GOD had GIVEN to HIM regardless of what MEN thought.  He called this man to stand in front of everybody because he wanted to leave NO DOUBT about what HE WAS GOING TO DO.
I would imagine that this man was a little embarrassed about being called to come to the front of the room.  When I get a COLD SORE on my face I IMAGINE IT to be the size of a baseball jutting out from my lip.  Jesus brought this man up from out of the shadows to stand in his PRESENCE before he worked the miracle.
Yet the eyes of the teachers and religious leaders were not on the mans deformed hand.  They knew he was there, but they were “watching Jesus closely…”  To these leaders, JESUS was the ONE with the DEFORMITY.  He was the strange one.  He was the one who taught about MERCY, GRACE, FORGIVENESS, LOVE and KINDNESS.  He was the one guilty of FALSE TEACHING with wild claims of the ABILITY to forgive sin.  
This man may have felt the stares – but all eyes were on Jesus.

Luke 6:9-10 (NLT) 9  Then Jesus said to his critics, “I have a question for you. Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing evil?

Luke already recorded that Jesus “Knew their thoughts” and now the penetrating stare of the creator looked intently at each of them.  Was he glaring at them?  Was he “putting them in their place?”  Was it a look of rebuke?  Was it to return their stare and let them know he was NOT backing down?  Why stare?

Not only does God know our thoughts, but the second truth about God is this:
SHOW ON SCREEN:
GOD IS WATCHING YOU.
His gaze is fastened on me right now.  His eyes were fixed on me when I was praying through this sermon, and his eyes are fixed on me now as I am delivering it.  He wants you to know something else: He is watching you right now. His eyes, filled with compassion, stare intently at you. 
Do you remember in your days of your childhood when you could FEEL the stare from your parents (typically when you were in trouble…)  Jesus asked these men a question and then made eye contact with each of the. One by one.
Can you FEEL his eyes watching you? 
Are his eyes penetrating your core? 
Are his eyes producing CONVICTION over sin in your life?

Jesus is watching.
He examines the heart of each of us.
He knows our thoughts before we think them.
He understands your motives behind every action and decision you make.
He knows if you are plotting, scheming, manipulating. 
He knows if you are pretending to love others or truly do.
The eyes of Jesus look at each of you.  One by one.  He looks at me.  His is the only eye that rightly judges us.  He judges with impeccable accuracy.  

Why is Jesus staring at you right now?  Why is God watching you right now? 

Because he is in the business of SAVING LIVES not DESTROYING them.

The purpose of his gaze upon our lives is not MERELY to bring conviction into our lives.  It is not to cause us to curl up in the closet and tremble in fear.  God watches YOU BECAUSE he LOVES YOU.  

Like a loving parents watches their child play in a playground filled with strangers – God doesn’t watch you to limit you, rather he watches you to guide, strengthen, talk with you, and RESTORE you when you fall.

	THE LORD WATCHES YOU TO GUIDE YOU.

	THE LORD WATCHES YOU TO RESTORE YOUR LIFE
	Luke 6:10B (NLT) So the man held out his hand, and it was restored!

If you become uncomfortable thinking about that powerful, penetrating, perpetual gaze of Jesus on your soul – If you begin to sense shame over sin, it is because God desires that you experience a genuine sorrow for sin over areas of your life.  There is a SORROW that GOD wants each of us to experience and that is a GENUINE sorrow over sin that leads us to repentance.

SHOW ON SCREEN:

	GOD DESIRES GODLY SORROW THAT LEADS TO A CHANGED LIFE
2 Corinthians 7:10 (NLT) 10  For the kind of sorrow God wants us to experience leads us away from sin and results in salvation. There’s no regret for that kind of sorrow. But worldly sorrow, which lacks repentance, results in spiritual death. 
Unless there is genuine sorrow of our sin, there is no repentance…if there is no repentance there is no expression that Christ is Lord in our lives, if Christ is not LORD there can be no pursuit of Holiness, if there is no pursuing holiness, chances are we are not truly saved.  

Yet there can be no genuine sorrow of sin in our lives unless there is CONVICTION that settles into our hearts.  That conviction comes from the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD focusing his attention on us.  If we sense his gaze, if we sense conviction, PRAISE GOD! It means you are loved by God and He has not turned away from you! Praise God, it means he is not finished working in your heart yet.  

There is NEVER a guarantee to MIRACLES – but throughout scripture we can see a pretty consistent formula that takes place over and over again.  Miracles often occur when MAN’s NEEDS, God’s MERCY, and MAN’s OBEDIENCE crash into one another…
How will you be obedient today?  Will you trust Jesus to save you?  Will you…?
