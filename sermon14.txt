MEETING JESUS
PURPOSE AND REJECTION
January 29, 2023
Luke 4:16-30

If you have your bible or your bible apps, I invite you to find Luke 4.  We are continuing in our sermon series “Meeting Jesus.”  For all of 2023 we will be preaching and teaching about life-change from the Gospel of Luke.  

If you did not bring a Bible with you today, the main scripture passage will be on the screen. 

If you do not have a Bible that you can read or understand easily, please stop by our bookstore and purchase a copy that you can read and understand easily.  

If you are here today and you are at the end of your rope…
If you feel broken, crushed and misunderstood…

I want you to know if you begin to read God’s Word and Apply it to you your life, your life is going to change!

In today’s passage of scripture we will discover that Jesus was rejected at the very beginning of his ministry, and how he handled that rejection.

Rejection is a terrible feeling.

If you have ever tried out for a sport but didn’t make the team, you know the feeling of rejection.

If you have ever interviewed for a job and you thought it went well, but never heard back from the employer, you know that feeling of rejection.

One of the first times I experienced rejection happened in Middle School. 😊

I was 13 years old, and I was in love.  😊

Her name was Rebecca Bumpus. We sat together for breakfast and lunch in the cafeteria.  We passed notes in the hallway.  And on occasion, when teachers weren’t looking, we even held hands. 😊

That relationship lasted for about one whole week. 😊

The reason I remember our relationship so well is because of how it was ended.

Our relationship began on Monday – but by Friday – Rebecca's best friend Marcine was sent to do her dirty work.  

Marcine Butts (that’s right. Her last name was Butts) sat down beside me in class on Friday afternoon and told me that Rebecca was breaking up with me.

Confused. I didn’t understand why Rebecca was rejecting me.  I asked Marcine, “Why is she breaking up with me.?”  

Marcine Butts replied, “Joe...you’re ugly.”

And those words of rejection lingered in my heart for years.  Anytime I was interested in asking a girl to “go with me” in middle school, high school, or go out on a date with me in college, I could always hear Marcine Butts 😊words in my head, “Joe, you’re ugly...”

Rejection stinks!

Especially if it is done in a way that gaslights you, manipulates you, or tears you down.

Help me out here. Let me know I am not alone in experiencing rejection:

	•	If like me, you experienced heart-break and rejection in school, raise your hand. 

	•	Raise your hand if you remember the person that rejected you.

	•	Raise your hand if you were the person that did the rejecting. 😊

(Shame on you!) Im kidding!

In today’s passage we are going to look at one of the moments in his life that Jesus was rejected...and learn how we can Deal with rejection we receive as followers of Jesus.  

If you are a follower of Jesus.

Meaning – if you had a moment when you understood that God created you to have a relationship with Him. 

If you believe that the penalty of sin separated you from God. 

If you believe that Jesus death paid the penalty for sin and through Jesus death and resurrection, you have been forgiven for your sins…

And you had that moment when it all clicked and you surrendered your life to Jesus and now have a friendship with God… 

Then most likely you have had to deal with rejection because of your faith in Jesus at some level. Maybe you have been rejected by friends, family, or neighbors because of your commitment to follow Jesus.

But maybe you have had to deal with rejection at a different level.  

Maybe your husband or wife has rejected you and abandoned you. They divorced you when you did not want to divorce them. Maybe the pain of that rejection still lingers.

Maybe your adult or teen children have rejected you.  You love them. You care for them. But right now, they have rejected you. No returned phone calls or text messages for years…

Even if you are not yet a follower of a Jesus – I think you will discover some heathy ways that you are able to overcome the feelings that rejection can bring in your life.

At this point in his life, the ministry of Jesus was just beginning. 

People were just beginning to talk about him. He had been baptized. As we looked at last week, he had faced 40 days of temptation and fasting in the desert. 
Then he returned to Galilee, filled with the power of the Holy Spirit and reports about him began to spread quickly through the region.  The people were excited and there was a “buzz” about him wherever he went.

And as Jesus traveled, he came to Nazareth, the town he grew up in.  Initially people spoke well about him – but after he began telling the churched-Jewish people that God loved those outside the Jewish faith – he experienced rejection.

Let’s read together Luke 4:16-30.

Luke 4:16-30 (NLT2) 16  When he came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures. 17  The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where this was written: 18  “The Spirit of the LORD is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that the oppressed will be set free, 19  and that the time of the LORD’s favor has come.” 20  He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue looked at him intently. 21  Then he began to speak to them. “The Scripture you’ve just heard has been fulfilled this very day!” 22  Everyone spoke well of him and was amazed by the gracious words that came from his lips. “How can this be?” they asked. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” 23  Then he said, “You will undoubtedly quote me this proverb: ‘Physician, heal yourself’—meaning, ‘Do miracles here in your hometown like those you did in Capernaum.’ 24  But I tell you the truth, no prophet is accepted in his own hometown. 25  “Certainly there were many needy widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the heavens were closed for three and a half years, and a severe famine devastated the land. 26  Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was sent instead to a foreigner—a widow of Zarephath in the land of Sidon. 27  And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, but the only one healed was Naaman, a Syrian.” 28  When they heard this, the people in the synagogue were furious. 29  Jumping up, they mobbed him and forced him to the edge of the hill on which the town was built. They intended to push him over the cliff, 30  but he passed right through the crowd and went on his way. 

This passage of scripture prophesied or predicted the purpose of the life of Jesus.  It predicted his mission. It summed up what his life was going to be like.

After he read this passage and began to explain his purpose – the people – his friends and family from his hometown – rejected him.

One of the truths I want you to understand is that:

LOWER THIRDS:

REJECTION HAPPENS TO THOSE LIVING WITH PURPOSE (v. 18-21)

If you are a person who lives with purpose – you know that rejection is going to happen.  

So, what was the trigger? What bothered the Jewish people so much? When we look back at the passage, we see it:

Neither the Widow of Sidon or the Leper from Syria were Jewish!

Jesus said: I have come to open the eyes of the blind, set captives free, bring Good News to the poor, and set the oppressed free…

But then he said to the “churched people” – not just for you! God wants people outside the walls of the Jewish faith to experience hope! He loves and cares for ALL people – including the broken, the blind, the oppressed and the rejected outside the walls of the church.

That’s what made the Jewish people so upset!

There are many churches that say they want to reach those without Jesus, but they don’t want “those types” of people in the church!

I am grateful to partner with Beach Church to continue to reach those in Myrtle Beach and throughout the world who need the hope of Jesus in their lives…even if they reject the message – we are still going to show them God’s love!

Now, rejection still happens to all of us whether it is because we are a follower of Jesus or because of our occupation:

	•	If you are a Real Estate agent, rejection is going to happen. 

	•	If you are a mechanic, people aren’t always going to be satisfied, rejection is going to happen. 

	•	If you sell insurance, cars, and are self-employed – you know rejection is going to happen.

If you are going to live with purpose, not everybody is going to like it and some people will reject, you.

If you are wondering about how people will continue to react to you if you do continue to live with purpose, look at how people reacted to Jesus.  

The very same people that spoke well of Jesus in one moment, were ready to throw him off the cliff the next moment.

That’s because…

LOWER THIRDS:

PEOPLE ARE FICKLE – THEY CAN BE FOR YOU, THEN AGAINST YOU. (v. 22, 28-29)

Look at verse 22 and compare them to verses 28-29.

Luke 4:22 (NLT2) 22  Everyone spoke well of him and was amazed by the gracious words that came from his lips. “How can this be?” they asked. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” 

Luke 4:28-29 (ESV) 28  When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. 29  And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.

Look, we live in a world full of sinners, and like the Apostle Paul said, I am worse than all of you. 

And because people are sinners. 

Because you and I are broken – sometimes we treat people wrong.  Sometimes we are like this group of people that rejected Jesus.

In 2014, I was voted in as the Senior Pastor of a church called the ROC.  This was a BIG DEAL in the evangelical world.  The ROC was recognized as the fastest growing church in the United States...Jonathan Falwell preached my installment service.  The Pastor Search team was giddy with excitement – whatever you need Pastor. I have your back no matter what...

Then 7 weeks later, I was fired because I had discovered that the leader of the Board of Directors had used the church as collateral and had taken out a loan of about $600,000.

I had baptized his grandson – the first 6 weeks we had baptized over 200 people...he claimed his face hurt from smiling so much.  Then – I was fired.  

Even when people say they are for you, they are not always for you if you live with purpose.

After I had surrendered my life to Jesus, was baptized, reading my bible and growing in my faith, I sat down with my grandmother to explain what had happened to me and how I had surrendered my life to Jesus.  

My Nana looked at me and said, “You have been brainwashed.”

She was FOR me if ever a person was! When I was going to be sent to a boys home after I had run away from home, Nana opened up her home to me and let me live with her for four years throughout high school. She fed me and clothed me and supported me.

Then – she didn’t like what I had to say about Jesus changing my life – and she said I was brainwashed.

You may hear this and think that I am suggesting we should not trust people. That is not even close to what I am saying:

I am saying that when people are fickle about supporting you – it hurts.  So don’t be like that!

Do you like it when people are for you, or against you?

Help me out by raising your hand:

	•	If you prefer people being FOR you and encouraging you, raise your hand.
	•	If you prefer people being AGAINST you and discouraging you, raise your hand.

It is always better to be like Jesus and be FOR others than AGAINST others.

Sadly, it is in our sinful nature to fail other people...and sometimes the same people who are for us one moment, can be against us the next moment.

That’s what happened to Jesus.  The same people who were pleased with him one moment tried to push him off a cliff and stone him the next – not because of what he did, but because of what he said.  

So... what how do we deal with rejection? How do we deal with rejection when we know sometimes people will be for us and against us, because they are human sinners too?

My advice, to make those times easier mentally and spiritually is to...

LOWER THIRDS:

BE CONFIDENT IN YOUR CALLING AND IDENTITY.

If you are going to live in this world for any period of time, you will be rejected. 

Your ideas will be rejected.  
Your presence will be rejected. 
Your personality will be rejected.

If you are convinced that your calling is to sales – be confident in your calling to sales, and in your identity as a salesperson.

If you are convinced that your calling is to cook great food, be confident in your calling to cook, and in your identity as a chef.

And...if you are a follower of Jesus – your main calling and your main identity is not found anywhere else but in Jesus.

	•	Remember, your calling is to be the salt and light of the earth.
Matthew 5:13 (NLT2) 13  “You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless. 

You are called to bring flavor and preservatives to this world by following Jesus – others are not like you and the world needs your flavor mixed in with it!

	•	You are God’s PARTNER.

2 Corinthians 6:1 (NLT2) 1  As God’s partners, we beg you not to accept this marvelous gift of God’s kindness and then ignore it. 

You are a partner with GOD! You can be confident that He is your Co-Worker and you are His.  He is working right alongside you caring for others, ministering to others, and loving others.

	•	You are God’s masterpiece.

Ephesians 2:10 (NLT2) 10  For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.

When you feel like more of a MESS-terpiece than a masterpiece, be confident that you may have messed up and sinned, but sin has not ruined your story. God calls you a Masterpiece of Grace, mercy, and forgiveness. You are beautiful and wonderful, a work of art.

	•	You God’s child and the evil one cannot touch you.

1 John 5:18 (NLT2) 18  We know that God’s children do not make a practice of sinning, for God’s Son holds them securely, and the evil one cannot touch them.

If you are a follower of Jesus, the devil cannot touch one hair on your head. You are protected, cradled, loved, and guarded by Jesus Christ – Live Confidently in that truth!

Jesus was confident in his calling and in his identity.  He knew what his purpose was and even when people rejected him and rejected his message – he kept on going. He kept on moving forward – because his calling compelled him and his identity strengthened him.

Let’s Pray.
