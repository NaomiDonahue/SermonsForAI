MEETING JESUS
The Word and Temptation
Luke 4:1-13
January 22,2023

If you have your Bible or your Bible app, go ahead and turn to Luke 4:1-13. Today, we are launching a series called “Meeting Jesus.” For the entire year, we will be in the Gospel of Luke.
I am so glad to finally be with you in person! For the last couple of months, we have been sorting through 23 years of stuff we have been collecting. We have donated, sold, or trashed much of what we owned – yet we still had enough to fill up a truck and drive cross country.
Our kids will begin school this week – so please keep them in your prayers!
We are launching this series called “Meeting Jesus” for a couple of reasons, but the most important reason is to reintroduce ourselves to the greatest life-changer that has ever lived: 
Jesus.
People believe many things about Jesus.
Some people believe Jesus came to suck the joy out of life and give people a bunch of rules to follow.
Some people imagine Jesus as a brown haired, blue eyed white man.
Some people believe Jesus is a republican, a democrat, or an independent.
Some people believe that Jesus is like a Genie in a bottle – if you rub the lamp through prayer, you get whatever you want.
Still, some view Jesus like a Mascot the church rallies around once a week.
Over this next year, we are going to seek to understand who Jesus really was, what he was really like, and how you and I can become more like Him.
We will begin in Luke chapter 4. If you have 
If you did not bring a bible with you today – we got you covered! The main passage will be on the screen.  
Let’s read:
Luke 4:1-13 (NLT2) 1  Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River. He was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, 2  where he was tempted by the devil for forty days. Jesus ate nothing all that time and became very hungry. 3  Then the devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, change this stone into a loaf of bread.” 4  But Jesus told him, “No! The Scriptures say, ‘People do not live by bread alone.’” 5  Then the devil took him up and revealed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 6  “I will give you the glory of these kingdoms and authority over them,” the devil said, “because they are mine to give to anyone I please. 7  I will give it all to you if you will worship me.” 8  Jesus replied, “The Scriptures say, ‘You must worship the LORD your God and serve only him.’” 9  Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple, and said, “If you are the Son of God, jump off! 10  For the Scriptures say, ‘He will order his angels to protect and guard you. 11  And they will hold you up with their hands so you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone.’” 12  Jesus responded, “The Scriptures also say, ‘You must not test the LORD your God.’” 13  When the devil had finished tempting Jesus, he left him until the next opportunity came. 

Jesus was in the desert. We lived in the desert in Arizona for four years.  When the heat is at its worst, hikers can dehydrate in just a few hours. During this 40 days in the desert, Jesus was tired, hungry, thirsty and weak.
And in the moment of his physical exhaustion, the Devil noticed Jesus’ weakened condition, and he attacked.
The Devil saw this as an opportunity to stop the ministry of Jesus before it even started. This was a no-holds barred attack on the character of the Son of God. 
Now, we may read through this temptation and think, “No big deal.” Why did Luke even write about this?
It is important that we understand…so write this down in your notes…

JESUS EXPERIENCED TWISTED TEMPTATION (v. 3, 5, 9)
The devil tried to manipulate and deceive Jesus by twisting truth with lies.
“If you are the son of God, turn this stone into bread.”  That challenge sounds biblical. 
When God rescued the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and they wandered in the desert for 40 years…and the Israelites and their animals were thirsty, Moses hit a rock with a stick and water came pouring out.
Every single morning, so they didn’t go hungry, God gave the Israelites food they called, “Manna”.
The temptation that Jesus faced was twisted – it was reminiscent of how God had worked in the past among the Jewish people.
Then, the Devil offers Jesus authority and claims it is his to give.  
That’s true.
	•	In John 14:30. Jesus calls the devil the “Ruler of this world.”
	•	In Ephesians, Paul the Apostle calls the devil, “the prince of the power of the air.”
	•	In 2 Cor. 4:4 the devil is called, “the god of this world.”
The devil stating that he had authority and power was accurate – but the statement was twisted. 
See, Jesus already had authority over ALL of Creation. He did not need the devil to give him authority and power. That’s how he stopped the rain, wind and waves. That’s how he stopped disease in its tracks.
Then the devil resorted to using scripture.
“For the scriptures say – “God will protect you.” So jump off this cliff and you will float safely to the ground.”  Jesus knew God was going to raise him from the dead – but not this way and not this time.
This entire attack of temptation was twisted and manipulative.  
And if somebody has manipulated you with partial truths, I am sorry. That is the worst kind of hurt because you trusted them, and they manipulated you.  
But make no mistake about it – 
Jesus WAS tempted to sin! If Jesus did not have a desire to DO these things – then Jesus wasn’t really tempted.
You see, The Devil tempted Jesus with what Jesus had already known, experienced, and had found pleasure and delight in.
Before Jesus was born in this world as a baby, he had existed as God. Before all of creation came into existence – Jesus WAS.
Colossians 1:15-17 (NLT2) 15  Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation, 16  for through him God created everything in the heavenly realms and on earth. He made the things we can see and the things we can’t see— such as thrones, kingdoms, rulers, and authorities in the unseen world. Everything was created through him and for him. 17  He existed before anything else, and he holds all creation together. 

As LORD and GOD – Jesus never knew what it was like to hunger – he was always satisfied. He never got hangry. 😊When the devil tempted Jesus – a full stomach must have appealed to him.  

And, Jesus knew what it was like to have AUTHORITY. All things were created through Him. Authority and power in this world was a temptation for Jesus because he Knew what it was like to have power and control.

Jesus was tempted by these things because he remembered what it was like to never be hungry, have ultimate authority, and never be in danger.

Jesus REALLY wanted to do what the devil dared him to do!

JESUS OVERCAME TEMPTATION THROUGH TRUTH OF GOD’S WORD
While the attack on Jesus was deceptive, twisted, and reminiscent of the truth – Jesus overcame the temptation through the truth of God’s Word.
Three times Jesus said when tempted, “The scriptures say.”
Jesus overcame the temptation to live selfishly and live for his own pleasure through the truth of God’s Word, and…

	•	YOU CAN TOO
Psalm 119:11 (NLT2) 11  I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you. 

Whatever wrong you are tempted with – If you allow the Bible to guide you, you can overcome it.

If you are tempted to Gossip – you can overcome it.
If you are tempted to be unfaithful to your spouse, you can overcome it.
If you are tempted to lie, cheat others, or lose your temper, you can overcome it.
If you are tempted to get high, get drunk, or do something stupid – you can overcome it!

Do a search on google for a bible verse in the area of your temptation. Memorize it. Tuck it away.  If you will commit to memory one verse that speaks toward living victoriously over the temptation you face, you will overcome.

Sometimes I convince myself that every other follower of Jesus has it together and I am the only one that struggles with the temptation to sin. 
I know others struggle with temptation to sin – but I sometimes convince myself that others don’t struggle like I DO.  
I remember many times sitting in church and thinking, “They read their bibles every day, they don’t struggle like me…Something must be wrong with me…”
Have you ever felt like that?
Have you ever felt like other believers had it all together and never struggled with temptation to sin?
Help me out by raising your hand:
If you have ever thought that other believers do not struggle like you do, would you raise your hand?
The apostle Paul wrote to followers of Jesus about temptation in 1 Cor 10, and he said:
1 Corinthians 10:13 (NKJV) 13  No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man.

Man, woman, or child, temptation is something we all experience.  

And just like Jesus faced in the desert, temptation OVERTAKES us all!
In 4th grade I was playing “Keep Away” on the playground. 
Keep Away was a little like Rugby and football.
We had two teams, and each team would kick off to the other team, and the receiving team would try to run the ball all the way back down the field into the endzone.  We would pass it back and forth…but if you were tackled with the ball, it immediately became the other teams ball.
The team kicked the ball off to us…I scooped up the ball and began to run like mad toward the end zone.  As the OTHER TEAM is chasing me down, one of my own teammates, Tammy Bill is behind me screaming, “Back Door!”  “Back Door!”
I had no idea that she wanted me to throw the ball back to her. I thought she was yelling at me to go toward the back door of the school…So I aimed for the door and kept going.
Suddenly, Tammy overtakes me, grabs the short hairs on the back of my head and jerks me to the ground.  
The ball fell…the other team picked it up and started making their way down the field.
Tammy is standing over me yelling, “I said, Back Door!” 😊
I felt confused and was disoriented.  I couldn’t believe one of my own teammates took me out.
For many, the feeling I felt lying there on the ground is the very same they have when temptation overtakes them and they give into temptation and choose to sin rather than to obey God’s will.
They think, I was running along so well, I can’t believe I did this….How did I wind up down here?
When you and I experience temptation – we will only be tempted to something we LIKE to do or find pleasure in.  
😊 I am never tempted to do something I don’t want to do. 
I will never be tempted to exercise more. 😊
Or eat healthy. 😊
Those are good things. Those are things I should do – but I am not tempted to do them because I don’t like them!
Around January every year – people make commitments to lose weight, and eat healthy.
Raise your hand if you made a resolution to eat healthier this year.
Raise your hand if you made a resolution to lose weight this year.
Raise your hand if you have already eaten something bad for you? 😊
The only reason you break a diet is because you have a desire to eat something you ENJOY!
If you are already a follower of Jesus – meaning – that one day – the Good News about Jesus death and resurrection made sense, and you surrendered your life to God and trusted Jesus as your Savior…

Then you understand how powerful temptation is. We don’t have to have the Devil standing over our shoulder tempting us, because the temptation we experience comes from within our own hearts.

James 1:14 “Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away.” 
Everybody say “Temptation comes from my own desires.”
A DESIRE to sin occurs only because we have experienced it or something similar to it before…and we liked it!
I am convinced that the sinful desires we have in our hearts, are stirred up by our MEMORIES. 
The temptation Jesus faced were from areas he had experience in. 
Before he became a human, he could do all He wanted to do.  
But when he became a human, he gave up his rights as God…and in the Desert…Jesus was tempted to TAKE UP his rights once again.
His MEMORIES of PLEASURE enforced the thoughts that the Devil flung at him. Jesus was tempted to take control of his human life and do what he wanted to do. 
Memories of experiences that appealed to us in the past, can stir up temptation in our present and future. If we liked it in the past, our flesh tells us we will like it again.
We may have messed up in the past – but we know if we give into those pleasures in the future, it could damage those around us, and hinder our relationship with God.
Parents, it is extremely important that you stand with your children to guard their eyes and hearts while they are young.  
Husbands and wives, don’t flirt with that old College flame on social media.  Don’t reignite those old memories that can trigger temptation to sin that will destroy your life.
Fill your heart and mind with the Word of God and stand firm.
Philippians 4:8 (NKJV) 8  Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy--meditate on these things.
Internet filters, cell phone apps, password codes for the tv channels…  If your child or teenager ever stumbles one time in this area – those lingering memories of what they saw will stay with them for a lifetime.
So be on your guard, because the

THE DEVIL STILL WANTS TO DEVOUR YOU (v.13, 1 Peter 5:8)
At the very end of the passage from Luke – we see the words:
Luke 4:13 (NLT2) 13  When the devil had finished tempting Jesus, he left him until the next opportunity came.
If you have your bible, circle the words “until the next opportunity came.”
1 Peter 5:8 (NLT2) 8  Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.
The devil hates you and he wants to destroy your life because you have surrendered your to Jesus.  He wants you to walk away from your faith. He wants you to create hurt in other peoples lives. He wants you to tell other people, “I tried that Jesus thing and it didn’t work.”
1 Corinthians 15:58 (NLT2) 58  So, my dear brothers and sisters, be strong and immovable. Always work enthusiastically for the Lord, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless.
