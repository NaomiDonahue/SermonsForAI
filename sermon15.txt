MEETING JESUS
PURPOSE AND REJECTION
January 29, 2023
Luke 4:16-30

If you have your bible or your bible apps, I invite you to Luke 4.  We are continuing in our sermon series “Meeting Jesus.”  For all of 2023 we will be preaching and teaching about life-change from the Gospel of Luke.  If you did not bring a Bible with you today, the main scripture passage will be on the screen. 

If you do not have a Bible that you can read or understand easily, please stop by our bookstore and purchase a copy that you can read and understand easily.  

If you are here today and you are at the end of your rope…
If you feel broken, crushed and misunderstood…

I want you to know if you begin to read God’s Word and Apply it to you your life, your life is going to change!

In today’s passage of scripture we will discover that Jesus was rejected at the very beginning of his ministry, and how he handled that rejection.

Rejection is a terrible feeling.

If you have ever tried out for a sport but didn’t make the team, you know the feeling of rejection.

In Middle School – I too experienced rejection.

I was 13 years old, and I was in love.  

Her name was Rebecca Bumpus. We sat together for breakfast and lunch in the cafeteria.  We passed notes in the hallway.  And on occasion, when teachers weren’t looking, we even held hands. 😊

That relationship lasted for about one whole week. 

The reason I remember our relationship so well is because of how it was ended.

I believe our relationship began on Monday – but by Friday – Rebecca's best friend Marcine was sent to do her dirty work.  

Marcine Butts (that’s right. Her last name was Butts) sat down beside me in class on Friday afternoon and told me that Rebecca was breaking up with me.

Confused. I didn’t understand why Rebecca was rejecting me.  I asked Marcine, “Why is she breaking up with me.?”  

Marcine Butts replied, “Joe...you’re ugly.”

And those words of rejection lingered in my heart for years.  Anytime I was interested in asking a girl to “go with me” in middle school, high school, or go out on a date with me in college, I could always hear Marcine Butts words in my head, “Joe, you’re ugly...”

Rejection stinks!

Whether it is in relationships, whether you apply for a job, at work, in court, rejection stinks. Especially if it is done in a way that tears you down.

Help me out here. Let me know I am not alone.

If like me, you experienced heart break and rejection in school, raise your hand. 
Raise your hand if you remember the person that rejected you.
Raise your hand if you were the person that did the rejecting. 😊 

(Get them!) 😊 

In today’s passage we are going to look at one of the moments in his life that Jesus was rejected...and learn how we can Deal with rejection we receive as followers of Jesus.  

If you are a follower of Jesus.

That is – if your relationship with God has been restored because you have surrendered your life to God by trusting in Jesus as your Savior. If you believe that Jesus restored your relationship with God and has forgiven you for your sins, and you have committed to follow him...

Then most likely you have had to deal with rejection because of your faith in Jesus at some level. 

But maybe as an adult, you have had to deal with rejection of a spouse. 
Maybe your husband or wife has rejected you and abandoned you. They divorced you and you did not want to divorce them. 

Maybe your adult or teen children have rejected you.  You love them. You care for them. But right now, they have rejected you.

Even if you are not yet a follower of a Jesus – I think you will discover some heathy ways that you are able to handle rejection in your life.

At this point in his life, the ministry of Jesus was just beginning. 

People were just beginning to talk about him. He had been baptized. He had faced 40 days of temptation and fasting in the desert. Then he returned to Galilee, filled with the power of the Holy Spirit and reports about him began to spread quickly through the region.  There was a buzz.

And as Jesus traveled, he came to Nazareth, the town he grew up in.  Initially people spoke well about him – but after he began speaking truth that was difficult for the people to process – he experienced rejection.

Let’s read together Luke 4:16-30.

Luke 4:16-30 (NLT2) 16  When he came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures. 17  The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where this was written: 18  “The Spirit of the LORD is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that the oppressed will be set free, 19  and that the time of the LORD’s favor has come.” 20  He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue looked at him intently. 21  Then he began to speak to them. “The Scripture you’ve just heard has been fulfilled this very day!” 22  Everyone spoke well of him and was amazed by the gracious words that came from his lips. “How can this be?” they asked. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” 23  Then he said, “You will undoubtedly quote me this proverb: ‘Physician, heal yourself’—meaning, ‘Do miracles here in your hometown like those you did in Capernaum.’ 24  But I tell you the truth, no prophet is accepted in his own hometown. 25  “Certainly there were many needy widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the heavens were closed for three and a half years, and a severe famine devastated the land. 26  Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was sent instead to a foreigner—a widow of Zarephath in the land of Sidon. 27  And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, but the only one healed was Naaman, a Syrian.” 28  When they heard this, the people in the synagogue were furious. 29  Jumping up, they mobbed him and forced him to the edge of the hill on which the town was built. They intended to push him over the cliff, 30  but he passed right through the crowd and went on his way. 

It was no coincidence that Jesus read that particular passage from the scroll of Isaiah.  He had already been working miracles outside the city of Nazareth.  People were speaking well about him...people were beginning to follow him.

This passage of scripture prophesied or predicted the purpose of the life of Jesus.  It predicted his mission. It summed up what his life was going to be like.

After he read this passage – the people – his friends and family from his hometown – rejected him.

One of the truths I want you to understand is that:

LOWER THIRDS:

REJECTION HAPPENS TO THOSE LIVING WITH PURPOSE (v. 18-21)

If you are a person who lives with purpose – you know that rejection is going to happen.  

If you are a Real Estate agent, rejection is going to happen. 

If you are a mechanic, people aren’t always going to be satisfied, rejection is going to happen. 

If you sell insurance, cars, and are self-employed – you know rejection is going to happen.

If you are going to live with purpose – not everybody is going to like it and some people are going to reject you.

If you are wondering about how people will continue to react to you if you do continue to live with purpose, look at how people reacted to Jesus.  

The very same people that spoke well of Jesus in one moment, were ready to throw him off the cliff the next moment.

That’s because…

LOWER THIRDS:

PEOPLE ARE FICKLE – THEY CAN BE FOR YOU, THEN AGAINST YOU. (v. 22, 28-29)

Look at verse 22 and compare them to verses 28-29.

Luke 4:22 (NLT2) 22  Everyone spoke well of him and was amazed by the gracious words that came from his lips. “How can this be?” they asked. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” 

Luke 4:28-29 (ESV) 28  When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. 29  And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.

Look, we live in a world full of sinners, and like the Apostle Paul said, I am worse than all of you. 

And because people are sinners. 

Because you and I are broken – sometimes we treat people wrong.  Sometimes we are like this group of people.

In 2014 II was voted in as the Senior Pastor of the ROC in Richmond VA.  This was a BIG DEAL in the evangelical world.  The ROC was recognized as the fastest growing church in the United States...Jonathan Falwell preached my installment service.  The Pastor Search team was giddy with excitement – whatever you need Pastor. I have your back no matter what...

Then 7 weeks later, I was fired because I had discovered that the leader of the Board of Directors had used the church as collateral and had taken out a loan of about $600,000.

I had baptized his grandson – the first 6 weeks we had baptized over 200 people...he claimed his face hurt from smiling so much.  Then – I was fired.  

Even when people say they are for you, they are not always for you if you live with purpose.

After I had surrendered my life to Jesus, was baptized, reading my bible and growing in my faith, I sat down with my grandmother to explain what had happened to me and how I had surrendered my life to Jesus.  

My Nana looked at me and said, “You have been brainwashed.”

She was FOR me if ever a person was! When I was going to be sent to a boys home after I had run away from home, Nana opened up her home to me and let me live with her for four years throughout high school. She fed me and clothed me and supported me.

Then – she didn’t like what I had to say about Jesus changing my life – and she said I was brainwashed.

I am not saying that we shouldn’t trust people – I am encouraging you to always BE FOR others.

I am saying that when people are fickle about supporting you – it hurts.  So don’t be like that!

Do you like it when people are for you, or against you?

Help me out by raising your hand:

If you prefer people being FOR you and encouraging you, raise your hand.
If you prefer people being AGAINST you and discouraging you, raise your hand.

It is always better to be like Jesus and be FOR others.  

Sadly, it is in our sinful nature to fail other people...and sometimes the same people who are for us one moment, can be against us the next moment.

That’s what happened to Jesus.  The same people who were pleased with him one moment tried to push him off a cliff and stone him the next – not because of what he did, but because of what he said.  

Because he was living with purpose...

So... what how do we deal with rejection? How do we deal with rejection when we know sometimes people will be for us and against us, because they are human sinners too?

My advice, to make those times easier mentally and spiritually is to...

LOWER THIRDS:

BE CONFIDENT IN YOUR CALLING AND IDENTITY.

If you are going to live in this world for any period of time, you will be rejected. Your ideas will be rejected.  Your presence will be rejected. Your purpose will be rejected.

If you are convinced that your calling is to sales – be confident in your calling to sales, and in your identity as a salesperson.

If you are convinced that your calling is to cook great food, be confident in your calling to cook, and in your identity as a chef.

And...if you are a follower of Jesus – your main calling and your main identity is not found in anywhere else but in Jesus.

	•	Remember, your calling is to be the salt and light of the earth.
Matthew 5:13 (NLT2) 13  “You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless. 

	•	You have been chosen by God and called to bear fruit.
John 15:16 (NLT2) 16  You didn’t choose me. I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for, using my name.

	•	You are God’s coworker.
2 Corinthians 6:1 (NLT2) 1  As God’s partners, we beg you not to accept this marvelous gift of God’s kindness and then ignore it. 

	•	You are God’s masterpiece.
Ephesians 2:10 (NLT2) 10  For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.

	•	You have been born from God and the evil one cannot touch you.
1 John 5:18 (NLT2) 18  We know that God’s children do not make a practice of sinning, for God’s Son holds them securely, and the evil one cannot touch them.

Jesus was confident in his calling and in his identity.  He knew what his purpose was and even when people rejected him and rejected his message – he kept on going. He kept on moving forward – because his calling compelled him and his identity strengthened him.

Let’s Pray.
