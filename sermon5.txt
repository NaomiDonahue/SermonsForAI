CRUSHED

Have you ever ASKED somebody for something, but it was difficult to get the words out of your mouth?  You had a great need – and you were certain that individual would help – but you still had a hard time making the request.?
Most of you know, I grew up poor – my dad drank away most of our money.  We lived on Government assistance, food stamps, and Medicaid.  I recall a conversation with my dad and my mom in which dad insisted that mom call her cousin RUTHIE and ask for money. Though my mom resisted, my father persisted and she made the phone call.
I crept into her bedroom and listened to her make the call.
She sat on the foot of her bed, and quietly asked Ruthie for help…and Ruthie agreed to help us out – one last time.
TRANSITION: It is difficult to ask for help, isn’t it?  It makes us uncomfortable.  We want to portray an attitude of strength – and we consider it weakness to ask somebody for help when we need it.
As we have seen in the Book of Nehemiah, when the going got tough, the people of Jerusalem were faced with a choice.  Either the attacks they experienced would weaken their faith in God – or the attacks they experienced would INCREASE their faith in GOD. 
That same “story” has been playing out over and over again.  
Some Christians respond to difficulties and trials by growing stronger in their faith and trust…
…and others allow those difficulties to drive a wedge between their relationship with GOD, their church, and others.
No matter what conflicts and attacks Nehemiah faced as they worked on rebuilding the wall – one of the first things he did was PRAY. 
Simply put, PRAYER is CONVERSATION with GOD.  It involves us listening by reading the word and allowing his Spirit to speak to us, and it involves us TALKING to HIM.
😊 My wife has an odd way of starting conversations with me.  She always begins every conversation the same way.  She asks, “Hey – are you even listening to me?” 
Every Christian knows the importance of PRAYER – that being said, I want to ask a question.  If Christians understand how important and POWERFUL prayer is, 
Why Do We Stop Praying?
This morning, I want us to take a look at a well known prayer of Jesus from the Garden of Gethsemane and I want you to walk away with a very simple truth:
Christians stop praying, because sometimes GOD’S WILL HURTS.
ILLUSTRATION: HOW I STOPPED MEANING my PRAYERS after our MISCARRIAGE…

The truth is, I wanted to PRAY God’s will be done – but I didn’t want to accept it if we lost Sofia through miscarriage.

Have you been there?  Have you ever WANTED God’s will to be worked out in your life – but you really didn’t want to accept it?  Cancer? A Divorce?  A Death? Financial hardship?  

I hope that God will minister to you this morning as we examine Jesus prayer that we all know so well: “Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done.”

SHOW ON SCREEN:

Mark 14:32-36 (NLT) 32  They went to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and Jesus said, “Sit here while I go and pray.” 33  He took Peter, James, and John with him, and he became deeply troubled and distressed. 34  He told them, “My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.” 35  He went on a little farther and fell to the ground. He prayed that, if it were possible, the awful hour awaiting him might pass him by. 36  “Abba, Father,” he cried out, “everything is possible for you. Please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine.” 

The Olive Grove, the Garden of Gethsemane was one of the special places that Jesus had. 
It was here in this special place that Jesus would face one of his most crucial tests.  It is important to note the MANNER in which that Jesus entered the Garden that night.  

He wasn’t skipping joyfully through the Garden. 

He did not rush into God’s presence light hearted and whimsically.

Mark provides us with some words that described Jesus mood that night:

…he became deeply troubled and distressed. 34  He told them, “My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death.

PERILUPOS: (Perr – ree – la- pos) GRIEVED ALL AROUND, INTENSELY SAD
Jesus used these WORDS to describe his condition to his DISCIPLES!  Within these sentences, Jesus communicated a sense of bewilderment, fear, uncertainty and anxiety.
This was the very same man who had taught his DISCIPLES to be JOYFUL when facing persecution.  What was causing this trauma? Jesus had just had dinner with his disciples – he just finished singing a hymn of worship with his disciples – and now – as if from out of nowhere – Jesus is “crushed to the point of death!”  
Let’s look ahead and see the SUBJECT of his fear. He called The SUBJECT of his AGONY, the CUP of SUFFERING.
SHOW ON SCREEN:
Mark 14:35-36 (NLT) Please take this cup of suffering away from me. 
This was the same CUP that Jesus referred to in Mark 10 when he said to the disciples:
SHOW ON SCREEN:
Mark 10:38 (NLT)  …“You don’t know what you are asking! Are you able to drink from the bitter cup of suffering I am about to drink? 

What was in the cup that was so utterly distressing to Jesus as He contemplated drinking of it? We naturally associate Jesus’ cup with the crucifixion and assume that He was praying that He might be spared the wretched and degrading death on the cross. The cup was indeed connected with the crucifixion, but we still have not answered the question: What was in the cup?

In both the Old and New Testaments, the cup is often used as a metaphor for the wrath of God. 

SHOW ON SCREEN:

Isaiah 51:17 (NLT) 17  Wake up, wake up, O Jerusalem! You have drunk the cup of the LORD’s fury. You have drunk the cup of terror, tipping out its last drops.   Jeremiah 25:15 (NLT) 15  This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from my hand this cup filled to the brim with my anger, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it. 
 Isaiah called it a cup of terror. 

Jeremiah called it a cup filled to the brim with God’s anger.   

Habakkuk called it a cup of the Lord’s Judgement 

Habakkuk 2:16 (NLT) 16  But soon it will be your turn to be disgraced. Come, drink and be exposed! Drink from the cup of the LORD’s judgment, and all your glory will be turned to shame. 
In Revelation, John writes that in the end days, people would rather be crushed under mountains and rocks than face God’s wrath:
Revelation 6:15-17 (NLT) 15  Then everyone—the kings of the earth, the rulers, the generals, the wealthy, the powerful, and every slave and free person—all hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains. 16  And they cried to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb. 17  For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to survive?” 

WE SEE ILLUSTRATIONS OF GOD’S WRATH…

	•	The great flood of Noah…

	•	God’s wrath destroys Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and brimstone.

	•	God’s wrath is seen in the 10 Plagues upon Egypt.

WHAT IS WRATH? Paul uses two words to describe God’s Wrath:  In Romans 2:8 we read that CUP was filled with the ANGER and WRATH of GOD toward sin.

SHOW ON SCREEN:

WRATH DEFINITION:

Romans 2:8 (NLT) 8  But he will pour out his anger and wrath on those who live for themselves, who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness.

ORGE: (orgay) A settled attitude of mind – disposition. 

THUMOS: (thoo-mos)Passion, as if breathing hard. Boiling agitation of the feelings, stirred emotions

It was not the physical agony of the beatings, the scourging and the crucifixion that Jesus so dreaded.  It was the spiritual agony He would experience as he drank every last drop of God’s wrath that we deserved.  
In the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus was staring directly INTO that CUP OF SUFFERING.  
 Understanding this now should now help us understand this passage of scripture as we were meant to understand it.

	•	Jesus did not trip over a stone in the Garden.  

	•	He did not wearily stretch out his hands, get down to his knees and lay down.

Mark writes these words using the imperfect tense for the word “fell.”  Quite literally it originally reads:
“And having gone a little farther, he was falling on the ground and he was praying…”
Mark is painting a picture of Jesus staggering and stumbling under the weight of the CUP OF WRATH until he finally collapses to the ground the whole time praying in agony.
	•	He FELL Down.
	•	Crushed by agony of GOD’s WRATH.
	•	Crushed by fear of God’s TERROR.
	•	Crushed by grief of God’s JUDGEMENT.
	•	THE WRATH of GOD was UNLEASHED on HIM! 
	•	The BURDEN and the AGONY were so great he could not stand up.
	•	He FELL to the ground.
This was not a pretty picture of the Savior of the WORLD! Jesus is supposed to be our strength, our fortress, our rock, our redeemer.  
CAN YOU SEE HIM?  HE IS STAGGERING and FALLING to the ground under the weight of GOD’s WRATH being poured out on him…and he CRIES out “DADDY!”
Crushed to the GROUND and PRAYING, he addressed his prayer to ABBA Father – in Aramaic there is not other word for FATHER as intimate and PERSONAL.  (This should be building to an EMOTIONAL moment for the church…) 
JESUS knew that WITH GOD anything was possible. Therefore, he cries out to his DADDY in heaven – PLEASE IF THERE IS any OTHER WAY – do it! Let this cup pass! 
Jesus asked that GOD would allow the CUP of WRATH to PASS.  And then, as he lay on the ground in the Garden – he uttered the words – nevertheless – NOT MY WILL but YOURS be DONE.
He said – Daddy – Don’t do this! Find another way… but if this is the only way – let YOUR WILL BE DONE.
	•	Jesus drank every last drop of the FURY of GOD at yours and my sin.
	•	Jesus drank every DROP of GOD’s WRATH of yours and my sin.
	•	Jesus DRANK every drop of GOD’S ANGER at our sin.
HE TOOK IT ALL! All of GOD’s WRATH was poured out on his SON JESUS. 
So you see, 
	•	A CHRISTIAN should never allow GUILT to prevent them from PRAYING.
	•	A CHRISTIAN should never allow DEPRESSION to keep them from PRAYING.
	•	A CHRISTIAN should never allow FEAR to KEEP them from PRAYING…
	•	A CHRISTIAN should never allow DISOBEDIENCE to keep them from PRAYING…
JESUS PAID IT ALL! COMPLETELY. EVERY DROP of GOD’s WRATH was poured out on Jesus.
	•	The CHRISTIAN IS FREE from GOD’s CONDEMNATION.
	•	The CHRISTIAN is FREE from GOD’s ANGER over SIN.
NOTHING CAN separate us from the LOVE of GOD any longer.  Because the CHRISTIAN has trusted by FAITH that JESUS SUFFICIENTLY accepted GOD’s WRATH over their SIN – by GOD’s GRACE the CHRISTIAN is FREE from the bondage of sin!
HE HAS TRULY PAID IT ALL.

EXCEPT for those without JESUS. Except for those who are not yet saved.
Look again at Romans 2:8 and let these words sink deep into your heart:

Those who REJECT the GIFT of SALVATION through Jesus on this earth will receive God’s ANGER and WRATH.
If the Son of God feared the CUP OF SUFFERING, how much more should those without Jesus?
And how much more so should we live lives concerned about those we know who are unsaved?
